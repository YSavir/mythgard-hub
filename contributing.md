# Contributing to Mythgard Hub #

Thank you for supporting MGH! We appreciate your support and your time. Here are a few bits of info that you may want to read before you get going.

## Code of Conduct ##

Be good to each other. No harassment will be tolerated. See [https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/7e117312a90aa67f8598674adc1d6c16d1259739/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](atom code of conduct) for more details if you need help. Report violations in the [MGH discord](https://discord.gg/RBX3zeG). 

## What do you need help with? ##

1. Report bugs. Provide as much detail as possible. Include the URL and a screenshot whenever possible. 
1. Feature requests. We want to make MGH as awesome as possible, so if you have a feature request we're happy to hear it. We may not be able to make it happen due to resource constraints, but we appreciate the contribution nonetheless. Please be as specific as possible. And make sure to mention why you want the feature, as we may have another idea for solving your problem.
1. Code. Let us know in the [MGH discord](https://discord.gg/RBX3zeG) if you would like to help us code MGH. We may need you to acknowledge a CLA (contributor license agreement). 

## Getting started ##

1. Fork the app on Github
1. Make sure you read the [readme.md](https://github.com/mythgard-hub/mythgard-hub/blob/master/README.md). Try to get the app running and confirm tests are passing for you. If you have any issues, please reach out on the [MGH discord](https://discord.gg/RBX3zeG) - we're happy to help.
1. We greatly appreciate new cypress or jest tests, although they're not required in all cases and we can help with them if you need help.
1. Please lint your code and check for javascript errors and warnings. Please test your code manually.
1. Create a PR
1. Expect some change requests or questions. We're trying to write a good app that will work well for years to come, and we believe that a thorough code review is a critical step. Feel free to disagree with our requests, but please explain why you disagree. The goal is simply to build the best app possible for the community. Number of comments and change requests does not correlate inversely with code quality. Coding is hard - this step is to help each other out, learn new stuff, and polish our work - not for ego.
